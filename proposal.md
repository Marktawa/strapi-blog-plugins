# **Title**: 3 Plugins to power up your Strapi Blog

## **Description**

Plugins are a powerful tool you can use to customize your Strapi app. [The Strapi Market](https://market.strapi.io/) is the official marketplace to find plugins and has more than 60 plugins to choose from. These plugins were created by the Strapi team, technology and solution partners, as well as individual community members. You can find plugins that integrate Strapi with other tools, such as Sentry, Mux, Moesif, as well as plugins that extend Strapi features, such as SEO, content versioning, comments moderation, internationalization, database configuration, sitemap and more.

This tutorial aims to show how you can enhance functionality in your Strapi blog, by making use of 3 plugins from the Strapi Market. We will use the official Strapi SEO plugin to make your content more SEO friendly, the Internationalization (i18n) plugin to help distribute the content in different languages and the Comments plugin to moderate comments in our blog. We will create a simple static blog with Strapi as the backend and Jekyll for the frontend. We will then install the plugins and demonstrate their use cases. At the end of this tutorial, you should have an understanding of how you can install and use plugins from the Strapi Market to power up your app.
